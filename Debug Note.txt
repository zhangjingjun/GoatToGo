Bug Fixed:
In MainController
1 Node saving problem, node is saving properly right now.
2 Edge delete problem, ATTENTION: EdgeID can't be used as Index when try to delete Edge!!!

In AdminMapDisplayPanel
3 Allow delete Point/Edge operation been executed in any mode

In AdminMapEdit
4 Refresh panel after point been deleted

Bug Remained:
1 Cannot save Edges properly.
2 EdgeID need to be renumbered after one Edge has been deleted!


Demands:
ModelSubsystem: Provide an method setID(int ID) for Node and Edge class that allows me to reset the ID;


Possible Feature:
1 Auto show preview in Add/Delete MapPage
2 Consider about adding Keyboard response? For enter?
